not a resolution
or could just be made one
not a big deal
not an issue to use the word
but i'm somehow adverse to using it

it's just that i feel the need to write
and don't want to do it in Day One
the app
as that's just too bloated for what i'm doing
so here i am
opening up a new obsidian vault

what's prompted this endeavor?
this dramatic movement to put pen to paper?

ninong larry died 3 weeks ago

dean wollrabe died very recently
don't yet know when or how

also head that alan passed away
again, not sure when or how

so yea, some heavy fucking shit

on thing i catch myself doing
with all of this going on
is to just sit with the feelings that come up
it's mostly a physical thing
how it feels in my chest
how the tears well up in my eyes
there's a certain sensation in and around my head
so yea
physical
not sure if i'm doing that right
of course there's no wrong way
and i realize now
that i'm here writing this
to deal with it from that intelectual
or at least verbal
or at least an approach tied to language

gotta head out
gonna watch thomas for a while

just setup
now at anna's
getting along much better w tom
the fix?
direct my attention at him
learn more about him
get to better understand him
to know him
how easy was that?

with whomelse i can do similar with


this from stinette:

dean took his own life


in the dealing with it department
i've been thinking
that one trick to get me to do the work
the work i want to do between myself and mom
is to do the writing at river bend park

the narrative is set there
why not write it there

i've complained that i don't want to be 
a guy writing it, and crying through the whole thing
while i'm sitting in temple coffee
nor do i want to write it at dad's place
not sure why i don't feel comfortable enough there
it's just kind of a thing
more of a thing then the temple thing
a thing a ling if you will


![[attachments/Pasted image 20230107162055.png]]

this was in the program i designed
for the celebration of life for
ninong larry

built this flower and the next in midjourney
that took a lot of fucking effort
more than i'd expected
pretty happy with the way this one came out
not as satisfied with the stemmed rose
but maybe i push that one further
seth said he liked it

so in thinking about ninong larry today
i started thinking about these images
and decided that i'd print the tightly cropped rose above
and give the print to jen

since seth was touched by the stemmed flower image
i decided i'd print that one for him

#### i'd kind of like to make something for dean


this is the one i'll print for seth:

such low resolution
i don't know how that slipped through
it's blatantly soft
*insert serenity prayer here*
so this one i'll keep working on

again
not sure what i'm supposed to do
but i feel like i need to be present with this experience
i feel like i need to allow myself to feel
